## What Is TreeJS??

Oh look! A wandering storyteller! What story does he have to say?

### The History

_Long ago, there was a JS library called jQuery. It was the most popular library, mostly because it was the only library of it's kind that existed._
Well, lots of lines of code later, today there are 1000s alternatives to jQuery. These come in _all_ shapes and sizes - speed, portability, functionality. TreeJS is another shape of jQuery.

### What's Different in TreeJS?

- No Virtual DOM hanky-panky going around: _It's just plain vanilla DOM_
- Full TypeScript support: _Parameters and return values have appropriate types_
- No repetitive code: _Functions call other functions when similar functionality is needed_
- Potential to extend code: _100% human-readable open-source code, meaning even **you** can create a plugin/extension!_
- Smaller build sizes: _We estimate that the total build size would be around 50-60 kB, and with community support, the code can be even more optimized_
- ...and much more!

### Who Should Use TreeJS?

People who want speed. People who want simplicity. People who want to edit DOM without affecting User Experience. People who like to _understand_ the code rather than just _know_ the various functions available. People who _love_ to contribute to projects with great potential.

### Wow. When Can I Expect TreeJS to be out in Production?

That's right. TreeJS is _currently_ in development, and has not been tested on older browsers. It works on modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge).

Thanks for reading this ReadMe!


### What's With the Name?

What is DOM? DOM is a tree. What does TreeJS do? TreeJS modifies the DOM. TreeJS modifies a *tree* called DOM. TreeJS modifies a tree. It is written in TypeScript, but *compiles* to JavaScript. So you *can* say it is written in JavaScript. So, TreeJS written in **JavaScipt** modifies a **tree** called **DOM**. Simple as that.
